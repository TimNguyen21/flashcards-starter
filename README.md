# FlashCards

## Setup

### Fork This Repo

On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

---

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```


## How to start the Game

In the terminal enter and run the following code:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
